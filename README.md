# 🎯 DebateSettler Dashboard
> **Prove your point with data, without starting a war** 📊

DebateSettler is here to help you settle those classic debates about your working hours and family time—without the endless “You’re always late!” claims. Let’s be honest, perception is a sneaky trickster when all you have are memories to rely on. Now you can calmly show that no, you’re not always walking in the door after 19:00; most days you’re home closer to 18:00. Yes, sometimes you work late, but those evenings after 20:00? Just a few in the last two months, really. Better yet, DebateSettler isn’t about blame—it's about reassurance and finding common ground so you can agree on what's really going on and maybe even improve things together. Because sometimes, it’s not as tough as it seems—just a little data, a little empathy, and a lot less grumbling.

A **pure static HTML/CSS/JS** dashboard that transforms your Toggl Track time logs into easy to understand visual insights. Optimized for GitHub Pages deployment with zero build process - edit directly on GitHub!

## 📊 Data Architecture

### **Smart Working Days Logic**
- **30-Day Analysis**: Statistics from last 30 working days (days with actual entries)
- **7-Day Trends**: Recent trend from last 7 working days
- **Calendar vs Working Days**: Excludes weekends/holidays without entries
- **Yesterday Boundary**: Data always ends yesterday for complete statistics

### **Advanced Filtering Rules**
- **Back Home Times**: Only days with actual commuting tracked
- **HomeOffice End Times**: Pure HomeOffice days (no mixed work patterns)
- **Edge Case Handling**: Complex day-mixing logic (HomeOffice + Commuting)

### **Raw Data Processing**

- **Client-Side Calculations**: No server dependency, works offline
- **Real-time Processing**: Metrics calculated on every page load
- **Debug Logging**: Console shows calculation details for transparency

## 🛠️ Development & Customization

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Serve the files locally (any static server works)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
# or just open index.html in your browser!
```

### **Customizing Colors**
Edit the CSS variables in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-400: #60a5fa;  /* Change primary color */
    --dark-100: #2a2a2a;     /* Change card background */
    /* ... modify any colors you want */
}
```

### **Adding New Metrics**
1. Add HTML in `index.html` for the new metric display
2. Add styling in `style.css` if needed
3. Add calculation logic in `script.js` in the `processRawData` function
4. Update the `updateUI` function to display your new metric

## 🔄 Automated Workflow

The GitHub Action runs daily and:
1. **Fetches Raw Data** (90 days, excluding today)
2. **Updates JSON File** (`data/raw_data.json`)
3. **Commits Changes** automatically
4. **Data is Live** immediately (no build step!)

### **Manual Trigger Options**
- **GitHub Actions Tab** → "Fetch Toggl Data Daily" → "Run workflow"
- **"Fetch New Data" Button** → Auto-opens GitHub Actions page
- **API Call**: Trigger via GitHub API for custom schedules
- **Local Testing**: Run `python scripts/fetch-toggl-data.py` with API token
