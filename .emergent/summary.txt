The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a web dashboard, , to analyze Toggl Track data. Initially conceived as a full-stack application with FastAPI and React, the architecture significantly shifted to a static React site hosted on GitHub Pages. This transition necessitated moving all data fetching logic to a Python script (executed by a GitHub Action) that stores raw data locally, and all metric calculations to client-side JavaScript within the React app. The engineer meticulously addressed various issues including initial setup, API integration, data calculation inaccuracies, and deployment challenges specific to GitHub Pages. Significant effort was dedicated to refining complex business logic for metrics like back home times and HomeOffice end times, including handling nuanced edge cases and ensuring statistics were based on working days rather than calendar days. The latest work involves adding 7-day trends.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is an attractive-looking web dashboard to visualize Toggl Track logs through simple, digestible metrics.

Initial requested metrics (last 30 days):
-   Total billable hours.
-   Time absent from home (excluding HomeOffice tag).
-   Mean, median, earliest, latest back home time (originally last Commute entry).
-   Mean, median, earliest, latest HomeOffice end time (originally last HomeOffice entry).
-   Frequency of working late (after 20h00).

Key evolutionary requirements:
-   **Deployment**: Shift from full-stack to static GitHub Pages, requiring API token removal and data fetched via GitHub Actions into a local JSON file.
-   **Calculations**: All data processing and metric calculations to occur client-side in JavaScript, based on raw (90-day) API data.
-   **Metric Refinements**:
    -   Display smaller daily mean for billable hours and time away from home.
    -   Back home time redefined as the last daily entry (including Commuting ones).
    -   HomeOffice end time redefined as the last daily entry with the HomeOffice tag.
    -   Statistics (30-day) to be computed over working days (days with actual entries), not calendar days.
-   **Edge Cases for End Times**:
    -   Ignore HomeOffice entries for end-of-day calculations if the day mixes HomeOffice and non-HomeOffice work.
    -   If a HomeOffice entry occurs *after* the last commuting entry, count it for billable hours/late work but not end-of-day calculations.
    -   Back home statistics must *only* consider days with actual commuting, excluding pure HomeOffice days.
-   **New Metrics**: Add the exact same statistics for the last 7 *working days*.
-   **UI Enhancement**: Implement a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 horizontal split for back home, HomeOffice, and a new Trends card.
-   **Trends Card**: Display color-coded arrows and text indicating trends for working hours (7-day vs 30-day billable mean) and coming home (7-day vs 30-day mean), with +/- 15 minutes as a normal threshold.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React.js**: Frontend framework for dashboard UI.
-   **FastAPI**: Initial backend framework, later deprecated.
-   **MongoDB**: Initial database, later deprecated.
-   **Toggl Track API**: External data source.
-   **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation for data fetching.
-   **Static Site Hosting**: GitHub Pages for deployment.
-   **Client-side Data Processing**: JavaScript for all metric calculations.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For UI styling.

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture transitioned from a full-stack FastAPI/React setup to a pure static React frontend that consumes a pre-fetched JSON data file.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The central component handling data loading, all client-side metric calculations (billable hours, time away from home, commute stats, HomeOffice end times, late work frequency, daily means), and rendering the dashboard UI. It now also implements the complex working days logic and edge cases for back home and HomeOffice end times. It contains the logic for 7-day stats and trend calculations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Completely rewritten from an API-driven component to a static data consumer. Introduced extensive JavaScript logic for all metric computations, dynamic display of working days, sophisticated filtering for HomeOffice/Commute edge cases, and the recently added 7-day statistics and trend analysis. UI structure modified for the new trends card.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Automates fetching Toggl data daily and updating  for the static site.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to run . Updated to save raw API responses. Configured to fix 403 errors during deployment by setting .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Python script fetching Toggl time entries from the API.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to replace the backend's data fetching. Modified to fetch 90 days of *raw* data and save it directly to  without any pre-processing.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies and build configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was removed. The  field was repeatedly adjusted to correctly configure the base URL for GitHub Pages deployment ().
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the compiled React application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to correctly reference static assets like  and ensure proper pathing for GitHub Pages.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides the browser tab icon for the application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created as a placeholder to resolve a broken favicon link.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the final stages of implementing the user's latest requests to enhance the dashboard's statistical analysis and UI.

The user explicitly requested:
1.  **7-Day Statistics**: Replicate all existing 30-day statistics (billable hours, absent from home, back home times, HomeOffice end times, late work frequency) but calculate them specifically for the last 7 *working days*. This is an *addition* to, not a replacement of, the 30-day statistics.
2.  **UI Layout Change**: Restructure the row containing the back home and HomeOffice cards to be a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 horizontal split.
3.  **Trends Card**: Add a new card in the third column of this split. This card should display color-coded arrows and concise text indicating two key trends:
    *   **Working Hours Trend**: Compares the 7-day mean billable hours against the 30-day mean billable hours. A difference of up to +/- 15 minutes is considered normal.
    *   **Coming Home Trend**: Compares the 7-day mean coming home times against the 30-day mean coming home times. The same +/- 15 minute threshold for normal applies. Importantly, coming home calculations for trends *only* consider days where the user actually left home (i.e., days with commuting).

The AI engineer's immediate last actions were:
-   Modifying  to incorporate the new calculation logic for 7-day statistics and the trends (Chat 346).
-   Adjusting the React component's JSX () to achieve the specified 1/3 layout split for the new trends card and to ensure existing  components were correctly integrated (Chat 347, 349, 350, 351, 352).
-   Building the frontend application after these code changes (Chat 354, 358).
-   Temporarily removing the  field from  to facilitate local testing, which is a common practice during the development of GitHub Pages applications to ensure the local build environment correctly serves paths (Chat 356).

The current state is that the code for these features has been implemented and the application has just been rebuilt.
